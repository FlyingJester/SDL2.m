# SDL2.m

SDL2 bindings for Mercury

This code is no longer maintained and kinda sucked to begin with.

If you want to do windowing and graphics in Mercury, consider using Saffron: https://osdn.net/users/alaskanemily/pf/Saffron

An example of doing audio in Mercury can also be found here: https://github.com/AlaskanEmily/audio_player
